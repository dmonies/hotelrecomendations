## Create Optimal Hotel Recommendations

# Description
Expedia launched a competition to create a model which would predict which hotel a customer would likely pick. The dataset has several different dimensions associated with customers and the hotels which they have booked in the past.  The dataset is also extremely large and can be downloaded directly from the Kaggle website along with details for the different features of the test data set.  The code leverages a feature selection framework to chose which features are best for predicting the outcome of which hotel a customer is most likely to reserve.  From there the model is evaluated based on test dataset after leveraging the training data as input for feature selection.
